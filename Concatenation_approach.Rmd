In the concatenation approach we will first concatenate the MSAs of all the loci into a single MSA (or 'supermatrix'), and then infer the species tree from the supermatrix.

Here we'll present species tree inference with [RAxML](https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/) and [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/). With RAxML, the MSAs for all the loci need to be concatenated into a single supermatrix prior to RAxML inference. With IQ-TREE, we can directly input all the MSAs files that will be concatenated internally by IQ-TREE.
